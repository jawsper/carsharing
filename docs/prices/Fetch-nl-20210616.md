Fetch car sharing has prices per minute, per hour, per day and per week. 
We always calculate the most advantageous fare for you per ride! 
So after an hour’s drive you don’t pay € 0.30 per minute but € 0.26 per minute for your entire ride. 
And after five hours our daily rate starts at € 78.00.  
You can rent the car for a maximum of 3 days at a time.
Per ride you have 250 free kilometers, each additional kilometer above costs € 0.25. 
And if you drive longer than one day, you get 250 free kilometers for each day.
